This course will equip students with the skills and knowledge to create impactful and responsible data visualizations using the R programming language. At the end of this class, students will gain proficiency in both fundamental (e.g. bar chart, bubble chart, choropleth maps) as well as advanced graph types (e.g. Sankey diagram, heatmap, parallel coordinates plot, faceted graphs) and know how to create them using R.
