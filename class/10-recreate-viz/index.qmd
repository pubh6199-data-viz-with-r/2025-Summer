## How to store API key without committing it to GitHub {.smaller-title}

::: smaller
To use the `{tidycensus}` package, you need to set up a Census API key. You can obtain one from the [Census Bureau's website](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).

You can store your API key in a `.Renviron` file in your repository's root directory (same directory as your `.Rproj`). Add `.Renviron` to `.gitignore` so that this file is not committed to GitHub.

Then in your R scripts, you can access the API key using `Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")`. This way, you can use the API key without hardcoding it into your scripts.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
library(tidycensus)
invisible(
  census_api_key(Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY"), install = TRUE, overwrite = TRUE)
)
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)
```
