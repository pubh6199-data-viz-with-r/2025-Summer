## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false

2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Make a plot

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(gear), y = mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#2a7ae2", alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "Miles Per Gallon by Gear Count",
    x = "Number of Gears",
    y = "Miles per Gallon (MPG)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
