## Before your start the lab notebook

- Update the header - put your name in the `author` argument and put today's date in the `date` argument.
- Click the "Render" button in RStudio and then open the rendered `4-lab4.html` page.
- Then go back and try changing the `theme` argument in the header to something else - you can see other available themes [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html). Notice the difference when you render now!
