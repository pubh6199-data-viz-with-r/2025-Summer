# 1. Get Organized

Follow these instructions:

1. Download and edit [this template](`r url_template`).
2. Unzip the template folder. **Make sure you actually unzip it**! (in Windows, right-click it and use "extract all")
3. Open the .Rproj file to open RStudio.
4. Inside RStudio, open the ``r hw_file`` file, take notes, and write some example code as you go through the readings / exercises below.

# 2. Video

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIID5FDi2JQ) on map projections:

# 3. Readings

This week we'll learn about maps and geospatial data. Maps are a unique type of data viz, and often times they are inappropriately or inaccurately used. These readings will help you learn best practices when visualizing geospatial data:

- Wilke: [15 - Visualizing geospatial data](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/geospatial-data.html)
- [XKCD: Map projections](https://xkcd.com/977/)
- Healy: [7 - Draw maps](http://socviz.co/maps.html#maps)
- Drawing beautiful maps: Parts [one](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.html), [two](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf-2.html), & [three](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf-3.html)

# 4. Reflect

> **This week, include in your reflection an image or link to a recent map you've seen (or one you thought was super interesting)**

Reflect on what you've learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing?

Write at least a paragraph in your ``r hw_file`` file, and include at least one question. The teaching team will review the questions we get and will try to answer them either in Slack or in class.

Some thoughts you may want to try in your reflection:

- Write about an interesting data visualization about trends you've seen.
- "I used to think ______, now I think ______ ðŸ¤”"
- Discuss some of the key insights or things you found interesting in the readings or recent class periods.
- Connect the course content to your own work or project you're working on.

# 5. Submit

To submit your assignment, follow these instructions:

1. Render your .qmd file by either clicking the "Render" button in RStudio or running the command ``r paste0('quarto::quarto_render("', hw_file, '")')`` command.
2. Open the rendered html file and make sure it looks good! Is all the formatting as you expected?
3. Create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.
