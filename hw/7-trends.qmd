# 1. Get Organized

Follow these instructions:

1. Download and edit [this template](`r url_template`).
2. Unzip the template folder. **Make sure you actually unzip it**! (in Windows, right-click it and use "extract all")
3. Open the .Rproj file to open RStudio.
4. Inside RStudio, open the ``r hw_file`` file, take notes, and write some example code as you go through the readings / exercises below.

# 2. Readings

Most of the readings this week have code in them that illustrate how to create each chart type, and I encourage you to try and reproduce the examples provided in R yourself.

- Wilke: [13 - Visualizing time series](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/time-series.html)
- Wilke: [14 - Visualizing trends](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/visualizing-trends.html)

Some examples of visualizations we'll explore in class:

- The "bar chart race": [Changes in how couples meet over time](https://flowingdata.com/2019/03/15/shifts-in-how-couples-meet-online-takes-the-top-spot/)
- The heatmap: [How common is your birthday?](https://www.vizwiz.com/2012/05/how-common-is-your-birthday-find-out.html)
- [Time-Series Heatmaps](https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-calendar-heatmaps-9f576578fcfe)

Optional:

- [The Sankey diagrams (a.k.a. flow chart)](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/sankey.html)
- Video: [The fallen of WWII](http://www.fallen.io/ww2/)

# 3. Video

This video by Hans Rosling is a great summary of his larger [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) on the "gapminder" project he started showing life expectancy and GDP over time. This is an excellent example of using an _animated_ chart to tell a much richer story than a static chart.

# 4. Reflect

Reflect on what you've learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing?

Write at least a paragraph in your ``r hw_file`` file, and include at least one question. The teaching team will review the questions we get and will try to answer them either in Slack or in class.

Some thoughts you may want to try in your reflection:

- Write about an interesting data visualization about trends you've seen.
- "I used to think ______, now I think ______ ðŸ¤”"
- Discuss some of the key insights or things you found interesting in the readings or recent class periods.
- Connect the course content to your own work or project you're working on.

# 5. Submit

To submit your assignment, follow these instructions:

1. Render your .qmd file by either clicking the "Render" button in RStudio or running the command ``r paste0('quarto::quarto_render("', hw_file, '")')`` command.
2. Open the rendered html file and make sure it looks good! Is all the formatting as you expected?
3. Create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.
