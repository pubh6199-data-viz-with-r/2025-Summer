## Before your start the assignment

- Update the header - put your name in the `author` argument and put today's date in the `date` argument.
- Click the "Render" button in RStudio and then open the rendered `3-hw3.html` page.
- Then go back and try changing the `theme` argument in the header to something else - you can see other available themes [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html). Notice the difference when you render now!

## Overview of HW3

This assignment is your first step toward building your final project for PUBH 6199: Visualizing Data with R. In the final project, you'll take a dataset, explore it, and tell a compelling and insightful story using **at least three different visualizations** (static or interactive). 


**Skills practiced**:

- Practice formulating clear, data-driven research questions

- Identify and evaluate potential data sources for visualization projects

- Plan appropriate visual encodings for different types of information

- Anticipate patterns and insights that can be revealed through exploratory data analysis

- Communicate project ideas clearly and concisely in written form 


## Q1: Final Project Format Options

Your final project must include **at least three visualizations** that work together to explore your topic. You’ll eventually work in teams of two, but for now, please brainstorm your individual idea and indicate which of the following formats you're most interested in:

You’ll have three format options:

1. **Same Question, Different Audiences (3 static charts):**  
   Create three visualizations that answer the **same question**, each designed for a **different audience** (e.g., general public, policy makers, technical experts).

2. **Same Data, Different Questions (3 static charts):**  
   Use the **same dataset** to answer **three different but related questions**, each with its own focused visualization.

3. **Interactive Dashboard (1 app with 3 components):**  
   Build an **interactive dashboard** (e.g., with `shiny`, `plotly`, or similar tools) that includes at least **three visual components** for exploring your data dynamically.

Please indicate which of the three options you’re most drawn to in your submission.

## Q2: Project Idea

Briefly describe your idea for a data visualization project. What topic are you interested in exploring? Why is it interesting and important? Feel free to use examples, images, etc to motivate your idea.

## Q3: Research Questions

List 1–3 specific questions you hope to answer using data. Good research questions are:

- Clear and focused  
- Answerable with the data you can access  
- Likely to benefit from visual analysis

Example:  
- How has air quality changed over time in major U.S. cities?  
- What factors are associated with higher rates of water insecurity across communities in the U.S.?

## Q4: Potential Data Sources

What dataset(s) do you plan to use? If you haven't chosen one yet, describe the kind of data you’ll look for.

Include (if known):

- Dataset name
- URL or source
- What the dataset contains
- Why you think it’s suitable

## Q5: Anticipated Visualizations

What types of charts do you expect to include in your project, and why do you choose this chart type? Try to name at least three types that might help you answer your research questions.

Example:

- Line plot of changes over time  
- Choropleth map of regional differences  
- Bar chart comparing groups

## Q6: Anticipated Findings or Insights

What patterns, stories, or surprises do you hope the data will reveal? It’s okay to speculate here — your goal is to show curiosity and a sense of direction.

## BONUS: Create an sketch

Try sketching one of your anticipated visualizations on paper! This helps you think through the structure, encoding, and message of your chart before jumping into code.

- Choose one of the visualizations you described in your plan

- Use pencil and paper (not code) to draw a rough version of what the chart could look like

- Take a photo and include it in your .qmd file using the code below:

```{r} 
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("../images/your-sketch.png")
```

If needed, add explanatory text below the image.

## Save and Push Your Work

Remember to save your `.qmd` and render the HTML output before committing to GitHub.

```{bash eval = FALSE}
git add 3-hw3.qmd 3-hw3.html your-sketch.png
git commit -m "Complete Homework 3"
git push
